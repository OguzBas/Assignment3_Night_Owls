																				<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
																				<p>Group communication was the most important factor that allowed us to produce us something for the last assignment, and it was also some sort of misunderstanding or bad communication that made us lose some marks for the last assignment. So this time, we tried to do better meetings. We have met as a group approximately twice a week on MS Teams. But it was not limited to MS teams that our group communicated on. We needed to use Discord for messaging. Whenever we needed to ask something, we sent messages on Discord instantly. So it really helped us in terms of communication and to set meetings on MS teams.</p> 
 																				<p>Our primary meetings were held on MS Teams, although we frequently have used Discord. MS Teams was so helpful because we were able to see each other, ask and answer questions faster without waiting to be responded to our messages. MS teams also helped us in terms of that everyone was focusing on a single topic so that we resolved the problems or issues better and quicker. Last one was Collaborate Ultra that we used for group meetings mainly after the pracs. So with that, we communicated 4 or 5 days a week with each other.</p>
   																			<p>For the last assignment, we had someone in the group who had never communicated with us. For this reason, we tried to email him, called him on MS Teams and even tried to write something on the discussion page at Canvas, but it did not help so we let our lecturer know about the issue. Luckily for this assignment, everyone did well in terms of communication, but if we had someone who was not communicating, we would do the same things.</p>
