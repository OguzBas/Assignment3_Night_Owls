									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<h3>Topic</h3>
									<p> The project is aimed to help users and provide them with support they need to address and seek help regarding any issues regarding their mental health and wellbeing and aims to be a stepping-stone or a first step to alleviating it. The project will consist of both a mobile and web application that would appeal to all age groups, focusing on app usability and efficiency to retrieve, store, track, and analyze user data. The app will be a professional online counselling platform that provides a low-cost alternative to face-to-face counselling through smartphones, personal computers, or tablets alike. Both the mobile and web apps will be a platform where groups and individuals can seek help and track their disparities in countries around the world. Like professional counselling websites like BetterHelp.com and Talkspace.com, this project aims to help individuals who may be suffering from mental health issues, as well as reducing the mental health disparities in countries around the world.
									</p>
									<p> With our planned project focusing on helping users get help they need, in regards to a sense of personalization as a feature, its likely outcome is that it would attract and appeal more to users. As our project takes it a step further in user personalization and allows our services to be different and varied and unique with each user, it would allow our project to be recommended to people and as more and more users use our service means that what we have done behind the scenes in our project is working and have successfully served its main purpose to help our users with their mental health and make a difference.</p>
                 <h3> Motivation</h3>
								 <p> The motivation for this project stems from the pressing issue of mental health problems and issues that impacts people in this day and age where exposure to social media is prevalent. This project is important because mental illness has long been something that many people have been trying to combat, especially since the rise of technological advances and use such as smartphones and computers. In relation to the current coronavirus pandemic, more people are staying home more than ever, albeit with their family, friends or by themselves. With staying at home, people’s activities on social media and online platforms and increasing, meaning people have more exposure to screen time. According to the Journal of Medicine, the effects of public health emergencies on individuals and communities such as confusion, emotional isolation, and owing to economic loss “may translate into a range of emotional reactions”, such as distress and psychiatric conditions (Pfefferbaum and North 2-2-, p.510). Furthermore, it Is estimated that 20.1 percent of Australians had a “mental or behavioral condition” in 2017 to 2018 (Cook 2019,  para. 6). In this current digital age and IT trends, applications that aim to provide users with help and services regarding mental health issues such as Code Blue that aims to provide teenagers who struggle with bullying, anxiety, and other similar applications that has a feature of using location services in order to suggest and provide support groups. If we were able to work on this project and produce a working application, it would show a future employer on how as developers, not only does it show how we made a complex application where every feature serves an important function but also the thought behind why we made the application where it makes an impact to an important issue and would help users who need it in a positive way.
								 </p>
								 <h3>Landscape</h3>
								 <p>There are a limited number of products available within the online mental health sphere, some businesses within this niche include BetterHealth, GetMosh and Online Mental Health Online. In addition, there are existing mobile applications such as MY3, notOK, and Moodlift to name a few. These competitor applications that are mentioned have one feature that are common and it utilizes GPS and location services that allows users to send their current location to support groups or chosen friends or trusted contacts if they need someone to talk to. What sets it apart from other competitors or similar products and applications is that our platform differs from these listed as it allows for the user to input their wants and needs via questionnaire or survey which will then set the user up with a suitable mental health professional and also enables users to find what specific services they need. This is done to allow for the users to have greater access to help and comfortability while using our platform. Furthermore, this survey allows users to be paired with the ideal psychologist for them as seeking help from a psychologist and booking periodic schedules is a commitment and finding the right psychologist for a user where he or she is comfortable with and the users trust. This allows our application to go an extra mile to allow a sense of personalization for our users as they get the help that they need.

										<h2>Aims</h2>
										<p>People may not be inclined to seek mental health treatment due to various reasons such as convenience, availability of counsellors in the area, financial reasons, or others. The main aim of this project is to increase more convenient options for groups and individuals who may need help in treating their mental health issues. This can be done by creating a low-cost alternative to face-to-face professional counselling through online platforms by the use of personal computers, tablets and smartphones, with a possibility of incorporating virtual reality. In addition, a secondary aim is to build a well-functioning and attractive mobile application for professional counselling where individuals can seek help and track their progress for their mental health.</p>

										<h3>Goal: Finish the design of the wireframe for the app on 16/Oct/20</h3>
										<p>A wireframe is mainly to create a low fidelity picture representation or design leading up to the mockup of the app. It is based on the elements that were described in Assignment 2 in the project idea. The reason why designing a wireframe for the app is important is it allows testing for different designs and functions of the app to create a user interface that the end-users would want to see. </p>
										
										<h3>Goal: Finish creating a mockup of the app on 16/Oct/20</h3>
										<p>A mockup is a medium to high fidelity picture representation of the final product. When creating the mockup, all the elements in terms of a counseling app must be included. In terms of design, principles such as layout, space, color, typography, and other visual elements would have to be taken into account. The mockup is important to get a feel of what the product would look like and how it would feel before proceeding on to programming the app. </p>

										<h3>Goal: Design a website version of the application by 17/Oct/20</h3>
										<p>The website version will have the same elements like the mobile application. The reason for making the website is to reach more users online and to increase the options available to people to access help online. </p>

											<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
											<p>As mentioned, the motivation behind this project to find ways to solve mental health issues and its ever-growing impact on society. Since the rising use of smartphones and computers in the 21st century, the exposure to social media is prevalent, and increasingly so as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The project would aim to allow people convenient access to counseling and therapy.  Therefore a mobile application was chosen as the main project because it allows people with smartphones and access to wifi are able to use it and is a great way to reach a wide range of audiences who might need help with their mental health in places that don’t have counselors available. </p>

											<h3>Initial Application Elements and Plans for Changes</h3>
											
											<h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
											<p>The original plan to include an efficient navigation bar was kept. In the app, users can access the home, progress, goals, meetings, and settings page from the bottom navigation bar. Elements such as FAQ, advice, language, about, account settings, and notifications can be modified and changed in the ‘Settings’ page. </p>

											<h4>Contents of the First page</h4>
											<p>One of the initial components that were planned as part of the app was having the first page of the app show the category the user identifies themselves in. For example, users can identify themselves as individuals, couples, teens, and children (under parental guidance), and corporate entities. This ensures that the app targets individuals and groups in society that are most prone to mental health. Once users have identified themselves in the category they fit in most, they will be led to a questionnaire that asks a series of demographic, psychographic, and geographic questions to more specifically identify the user’s needs. To add on, the survey would include questions regarding symptoms that may lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental problems. An optional test for users will be available for users to take such as the personality test or Big5 Test as additional information for counselors to gain insight on the user's personality and history to better help them. 
											<br>
											<strong>Changes to make</strong>
											<br>
												The changes to be made to this original plan is making the signup and login page the content of the page when users first sign up, instead of the categories page and showing the signup page after users have entered the responses to the questionnaire. The questionnaire is a psychological test that will take place to identify the type of help the users are seeking and to redirect them to a health professional best fit for their issue. The users also have the option to choose the type of counselor they prefer and their expertise in fields such as depression, relationships, family conflict, trauma and abuse, and the like. Since the questionnaire is designed to identify the type of users and their needs, the categories page asking users to identify themselves as individuals, couples, teens, and children, and corporate entities is not needed. 
											</p>

											<h4>Home Feature</h4>
											<p>The bottom navigation bar is planned to include the ‘Home’ function. On this page, several elements are to be included. Firstly, the ‘Book Consultation’ element, which shows a list of psychologists that the users can choose from. Users can book with a new psychologist or a psychologist they have previously met. Secondly, the ‘View Consultation History’ element, which shows details such as time, date, and duration of consultations with past psychologists. Thirdly, a ‘Find a mental health Professional’ element where users can choose from a list of mental health professionals that expertise in a range of mental health areas. The psychological testing questionnaire is accessed through this element. Fourthly, a ‘Written program and Regiment’ element. In this element, users can view their personalized program written by their chosen psychologist. This element aims to improve the user’s progress towards their desired goals. Lastly, the ‘Home’ page contains a timetable of consultations and agenda for current and future sessions. </p>

											<h4> Journaling Space Feature</h4>
											<p>In the initial description of the project idea, a journaling space feature was planned. It would provide a place for users to create journal entries where they can type, record, insert photos, and draw, which allows them to express their thoughts in different ways. 
												<br>
												<strong>Changes to make</strong>
												<br>
												The journaling space feature is to be replaced with the ‘Goals’ page. Users can set goals according to what they want to work on after consulting with a therapist. On this page, users can set multiple goals, and create strategies and break them down into objectives to make it more achievable. The reason for this change is so the app is focused on the user’s development and outcome as setting goals creates proactiveness. Users can focus on what they need to work on to achieve the outcome that they desire. 
											</p>

											<h4>Guided Meditation Exercise Page</h4>
											<p>Furthermore, in the initial description of the app, it includes a navigation bar element that contains Guided Meditation Exercises. The exercises are a form of meditation through breathing and visualization. Users can choose the type of exercise and the duration of 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. In addition, a reminder feature was planned to be included that sets daily, weekly, or monthly reminders of the app because it reminds users of exercises, tasks, meetings with therapists, and progress reports, etc. as people might be occupied with work, or simply forgetting to seek help. <br>
											<strong>Changes to make</strong> <br>
											The therapeutic exercise element has been removed and has to reduce the clutter within the app. Current applications such as Wysa and Moodpath are already emphasizing this component therefore it was decided that the project app should prioritize other elements. Instead, a ‘Progress’ page has been added to the replacement of the guided meditation page. The progress page includes both graphical and written progress reports of sessions held between users and their chosen mental health professionals. The report tracks how users feel in between sessions and how close they are to their goals. </p>

											<h4>Communication Method</h4>
											<p>The next feature that was kept from the initial project idea is a 1-on-1 session through online communication. The user can choose to communicate through a messaging room or a live chat session with their chosen mental health professional. The user can send video and audio recordings, upload files and documents, or call. The live chat session will be private and would require a passcode to enter for additional security. In the communication room, there will be two help features. The first help feature is an explanation of how the communication room works. The second help feature consists of a list of questions that the users may want to ask their psychologists in case they do not know how to get started with the type of questions to ask. The duration of the session can be stopped at any time and the user can request to change psychologists at any time via the ‘Home’ page. <br>
												<strong>Changes to make</strong> <br>
												The AI chatterbox that was planned in the initial description as a temporary replacement of unavailable health professionals is to be removed as it is an element that requires a high level of expertise to make the AI chatterbox accurately identify the emotional state of the user. 
												</p>

											<h4>Meetings page</h4>
											<p>The meetings page is planned to be accessed through the bottom navigation bar. This page shows any upcoming meetings for the user with their chosen mental health professional. The name of the health professional will be shown, along with the date and time of the meeting shown below their names. When users press on any of the psychologist’s names, a description of their profile will be shown along with a button to book a session with them. </p>

											<h3>Progress</h3>
											<p>After several meetings on MS Teams and Collaborate Ultra to discuss the prototype and the features, the final mockup, and prototype of the application is completed on Figma. Most of the initial and changed elements and features that were planned were included. The name of the app, BetterMind, has also been discussed and finalized to be an appropriate name for the app. After receiving additional feedback about the prototype of the application, no major changes have been made to the plan besides small adjustments in details such as font color and font size. In addition, we have set to remotely test this application out, with a plan to test on 40-65 people total, including therapists. 
												<br><br>
											For the website, there has been no progress due to time constraints. There wasn’t enough time to design a wireframe and create a mockup for the website version of the app. Therefore, it was decided that prioritizing the mobile app was more important and moved the website project to a later date.

														<h2>Roles</h2>
														<p>For the project idea, we need psychologists, program developers, and User Interface Designer.</p>
   													<p>First of all, the project needs to be developed by some kind of IT professionals, but as it is about mental health, it is a must to get help from psychologists. Because the project is about patients that have mental health problems, we need to design the app in such a way that it will be relaxing for the people who use it. We also need psychologists to prepare survey questions that will be very important for the doctor selection when the app is ready to use.</p>
   													<p>Second group of people that we need for the project are program developers. Basically, we need program developers for the whole project. We need some people who know how to use HTML, Css Javascript and PHP and SQL.</p>
   													<p>Lastly, we need interface designers or web designers. It is important to make the app updated in terms of user needs and usability. The design should also be helpful for those who are seeking help.</p>

																<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
																<p>Our scope is to develop an interactive app which is about mental health. We want that the app is well designed in terms of usability, it should have good page layouts and design patterns, sections and buttons to meet users’ needs. We also need to set up a payment method like Paypal and some other to meet the payment criteria.</p>
   															<p>We got some limitations though, in terms of group meetings, time and skills. Firstly, due to Covid-19, group members cannot meet face to face so we are doing online meetings. Again for the online meetings, we are trying to do the best to meet with each other but there are some issues like some of the  group members are living outside of Australia and some of us are living in rural areas so they may have bad internet connection from time to time. Secondly, because of the time frame that we are supposed to submit some other assignments for other courses as well, it is really hard for us to spend a substantial time on the design. Lastly, because of the skill deficiencies such as programming, limited knowledge about HTML Css, Javascript, Php etc,, it is hard to develop an interactive website at this stage. Although we already did some basic websites before by using Html and css, we have not done much with the javascript component. For this reason, we may need to take some professional advice, or we may need to try things out to better our web design skills but this brings the time issue again. Because of the limitations mentioned above, we want to focus on prototyping for the moment. Along with the prototype, we will do a group report and will explain the project.</p>
   															<p>At the end of our group work, we want to produce a medium or high fidelity prototype of the app. Figma has been used for the design. The prototype includes a login page, a short survey to know the patient better. Then, the main page is shown and it includes the main sections such as booking a consultation, current bookings and past consultation history. In addition, some buttons like settings and payments are shown in the main page at the bottom navigation. Prototype also includes a list that shows the health professionals including a short information about them and when you click on it, the user is directed to the page that shows their bibliographies related to what they do in the health industry.
																In addition to the prototype, we will also produce a group report in Pdf format that includes the information about our group members, project description, and the information about the group meetings. We will also do a website version of the report that is related to the report.</p>
   															<p>Our project is about setting up an app that will provide online consultation for patients that have mental health problems. This also gives an opportunity for the doctors who want to do extra work or who want to help the people. But, if we have the opportunity in terms of time and skills, we may want to add some other features in our project.</p>
   															<p>In terms of the industry that the project is related to, we can broaden the border and it can be a huge application that helps the patients and health professionals from all kinds of health sectors to meet for consultation and treatment. Of course, most of the time, doctors need to see the patients face to face and may need to touch the patients to detect problems, but there are also other times or other kinds of treatments and consultations that patients and doctors do not necessarily need to meet face to face to do what they need to do. So, this project can be also a good opportunity for those kinds of times.</p>

																			<h2>Risks</h2>
																			<p>For our project which would involve making a working application and service that aims to help and provide users with help and appropriate services available, it is important to think about the risks that might come up during and after development of the project. Developing a software for our project means that we need to learn how to use applications that would enable us to work on and produce a final product. Applications such as Appy Pie, Figma, and Lucid chart just to name a few would require us to take time and learn and maximize what these applications can do for our project and there would be no guarantee that the development would me smooth sailing as some might find it hard to get used to using a certain software development application for our project. Furthermore, coding or programming languages such as html, CSS, and JavaScript would also be taken into consideration as otherwise one team member has lots of experience coding maybe one or two programming language, it would still make a potential impact to the final product as not all members are experts immediately to all the programming language that the group decided to use. In addition, our project will utilize a questionnaire or survey for users which is then used for the recommended services and psychologists that is best suited for them. For this feature to function and work properly vital research and background is needed especially for recommending the right psychologist for a user and that poses a potential risk if our project or final product does not deliver or recommend a right one based on the user preferences. It would be difficult and a big risk in recommending the right service that is fitting to a user and definitely needs a lot of trial and error and testing for it to function properly which is also dependent on the user feedback.

																				<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
																				<p>Group communication was the most important factor that allowed us to produce us something for the last assignment, and it was also some sort of misunderstanding or bad communication that made us lose some marks for the last assignment. So this time, we tried to do better meetings. We have met as a group approximately twice a week on MS Teams. But it was not limited to MS teams that our group communicated on. We needed to use Discord for messaging. Whenever we needed to ask something, we sent messages on Discord instantly. So it really helped us in terms of communication and to set meetings on MS teams.</p>
 																				<p>Our primary meetings were held on MS Teams, although we frequently have used Discord. MS Teams was so helpful because we were able to see each other, ask and answer questions faster without waiting to be responded to our messages. MS teams also helped us in terms of that everyone was focusing on a single topic so that we resolved the problems or issues better and quicker. Last one was Collaborate Ultra that we used for group meetings mainly after the pracs. So with that, we communicated 4 or 5 days a week with each other.</p>
   																			<p>For the last assignment, we had someone in the group who had never communicated with us. For this reason, we tried to email him, called him on MS Teams and even tried to write something on the discussion page at Canvas, but it did not help so we let our lecturer know about the issue. Luckily for this assignment, everyone did well in terms of communication, but if we had someone who was not communicating, we would do the same things.</p>
