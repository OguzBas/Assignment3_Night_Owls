														<h2>Roles</h2>
														<p>For the project idea, we need psychologists, program developers, and User Interface Designer.</p>
   													<p>First of all, the project needs to be developed by some kind of IT professionals, but as it is about mental health, it is a must to get help from psychologists. Because the project is about patients that have mental health problems, we need to design the app in such a way that it will be relaxing for the people who use it. We also need psychologists to prepare survey questions that will be very important for the doctor selection when the app is ready to use.</p>
   													<p>Second group of people that we need for the project are program developers. Basically, we need program developers for the whole project. We need some people who know how to use HTML, Css Javascript and PHP and SQL.</p>
   													<p>Lastly, we need interface designers or web designers. It is important to make the app updated in terms of user needs and usability. The design should also be helpful for those who are seeking help.</p>

																<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
																<p>Our scope is to develop an interactive app which is about mental health. We want that the app is well designed in terms of usability, it should have good page layouts and design patterns, sections and buttons to meet usersâ€™ needs. We also need to set up a payment method like Paypal and some other to meet the payment criteria.</p>
   															<p>We got some limitations though, in terms of group meetings, time and skills. Firstly, due to Covid-19, group members cannot meet face to face so we are doing online meetings. Again for the online meetings, we are trying to do the best to meet with each other but there are some issues like some of the  group members are living outside of Australia and some of us are living in rural areas so they may have bad internet connection from time to time. Secondly, because of the time frame that we are supposed to submit some other assignments for other courses as well, it is really hard for us to spend a substantial time on the design. Lastly, because of the skill deficiencies such as programming, limited knowledge about HTML Css, Javascript, Php etc,, it is hard to develop an interactive website at this stage. Although we already did some basic websites before by using Html and css, we have not done much with the javascript component. For this reason, we may need to take some professional advice, or we may need to try things out to better our web design skills but this brings the time issue again. Because of the limitations mentioned above, we want to focus on prototyping for the moment. Along with the prototype, we will do a group report and will explain the project.</p>
   															<p>At the end of our group work, we want to produce a medium or high fidelity prototype of the app. Figma has been used for the design. The prototype includes a login page, a short survey to know the patient better. Then, the main page is shown and it includes the main sections such as booking a consultation, current bookings and past consultation history. In addition, some buttons like settings and payments are shown in the main page at the bottom navigation. Prototype also includes a list that shows the health professionals including a short information about them and when you click on it, the user is directed to the page that shows their bibliographies related to what they do in the health industry.
																In addition to the prototype, we will also produce a group report in Pdf format that includes the information about our group members, project description, and the information about the group meetings. We will also do a website version of the report that is related to the report.</p>
   															<p>Our project is about setting up an app that will provide online consultation for patients that have mental health problems. This also gives an opportunity for the doctors who want to do extra work or who want to help the people. But, if we have the opportunity in terms of time and skills, we may want to add some other features in our project.</p>
   															<p>In terms of the industry that the project is related to, we can broaden the border and it can be a huge application that helps the patients and health professionals from all kinds of health sectors to meet for consultation and treatment. Of course, most of the time, doctors need to see the patients face to face and may need to touch the patients to detect problems, but there are also other times or other kinds of treatments and consultations that patients and doctors do not necessarily need to meet face to face to do what they need to do. So, this project can be also a good opportunity for those kinds of times.</p>

																				<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
																				<p>Group communication was the most important factor that allowed us to produce us something for the last assignment, and it was also some sort of misunderstanding or bad communication that made us lose some marks for the last assignment. So this time, we tried to do better meetings. We have met as a group approximately twice a week on MS Teams. But it was not limited to MS teams that our group communicated on. We needed to use Discord for messaging. Whenever we needed to ask something, we sent messages on Discord instantly. So it really helped us in terms of communication and to set meetings on MS teams.</p>
 																				<p>Our primary meetings were held on MS Teams, although we frequently have used Discord. MS Teams was so helpful because we were able to see each other, ask and answer questions faster without waiting to be responded to our messages. MS teams also helped us in terms of that everyone was focusing on a single topic so that we resolved the problems or issues better and quicker. Last one was Collaborate Ultra that we used for group meetings mainly after the pracs. So with that, we communicated 4 or 5 days a week with each other.</p>
   																			<p>For the last assignment, we had someone in the group who had never communicated with us. For this reason, we tried to email him, called him on MS Teams and even tried to write something on the discussion page at Canvas, but it did not help so we let our lecturer know about the issue. Luckily for this assignment, everyone did well in terms of communication, but if we had someone who was not communicating, we would do the same things.</p>
