									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Topic</p>
									<p> The project is aimed to help users and provide them with support they need to address and seek help regarding any issues regarding their mental health and wellbeing and aims to be a stepping-stone or a first step to alleviating it. The project will consist of both a mobile and web application that would appeal to all age groups, focusing on app usability and efficiency to retrieve, store, track, and analyze user data. The app will be a professional online counselling platform that provides a low-cost alternative to face-to-face counselling through smartphones, personal computers, or tablets alike. Both the mobile and web apps will be a platform where groups and individuals can seek help and track their disparities in countries around the world. Like professional counselling websites like BetterHelp.com and Talkspace.com, this project aims to help individuals who may be suffering from mental health issues, as well as reducing the mental health disparities in countries around the world.
									</p>
									<p> With our planned project focusing on helping users get help they need, in regards to a sense of personalization as a feature, its likely outcome is that it would attract and appeal more to users. As our project takes it a step further in user personalization and allows our services to be different and varied and unique with each user, it would allow our project to be recommended to people and as more and more users use our service means that what we have done behind the scenes in our project is working and have successfully served its main purpose to help our users with their mental health and make a difference.</p>
                 <p> Motivation</p>
								 <p> The motivation for this project stems from the pressing issue of mental health problems and issues that impacts people in this day and age where exposure to social media is prevalent. This project is important because mental illness has long been something that many people have been trying to combat, especially since the rise of technological advances and use such as smartphones and computers. In relation to the current coronavirus pandemic, more people are staying home more than ever, albeit with their family, friends or by themselves. With staying at home, people’s activities on social media and online platforms and increasing, meaning people have more exposure to screen time. According to the Journal of Medicine, the effects of public health emergencies on individuals and communities such as confusion, emotional isolation, and owing to economic loss “may translate into a range of emotional reactions”, such as distress and psychiatric conditions (Pfefferbaum and North 2-2-, p.510). Furthermore, it Is estimated that 20.1 percent of Australians had a “mental or behavioral condition” in 2017 to 2018 (Cook 2019,  para. 6). In this current digital age and IT trends, applications that aim to provide users with help and services regarding mental health issues such as Code Blue that aims to provide teenagers who struggle with bullying, anxiety, and other similar applications that has a feature of using location services in order to suggest and provide support groups. If we were able to work on this project and produce a working application, it would show a future employer on how as developers, not only does it show how we made a complex application where every feature serves an important function but also the thought behind why we made the application where it makes an impact to an important issue and would help users who need it in a positive way.
								 </p>
								 <p>Landscape</p>
								 <p>There are a limited number of products available within the online mental health sphere, some businesses within this niche include BetterHealth, GetMosh and Online Mental Health Online. In addition, there are existing mobile applications such as MY3, notOK, and Moodlift to name a few. These competitor applications that are mentioned have one feature that are common and it utilizes GPS and location services that allows users to send their current location to support groups or chosen friends or trusted contacts if they need someone to talk to. What sets it apart from other competitors or similar products and applications is that our platform differs from these listed as it allows for the user to input their wants and needs via questionnaire or survey which will then set the user up with a suitable mental health professional and also enables users to find what specific services they need. This is done to allow for the users to have greater access to help and comfortability while using our platform. Furthermore, this survey allows users to be paired with the ideal psychologist for them as seeking help from a psychologist and booking periodic schedules is a commitment and finding the right psychologist for a user where he or she is comfortable with and the users trust. This allows our application to go an extra mile to allow a sense of personalization for our users as they get the help that they need.

														<h2>Roles</h2>
														<p>For the project idea, we need psychologists, program developers, and User Interface Designer.</p>
   													<p>First of all, the project needs to be developed by some kind of IT professionals, but as it is about mental health, it is a must to get help from psychologists. Because the project is about patients that have mental health problems, we need to design the app in such a way that it will be relaxing for the people who use it. We also need psychologists to prepare survey questions that will be very important for the doctor selection when the app is ready to use.</p>
   													<p>Second group of people that we need for the project are program developers. Basically, we need program developers for the whole project. We need some people who know how to use HTML, Css Javascript and PHP and SQL.</p>
   													<p>Lastly, we need interface designers or web designers. It is important to make the app updated in terms of user needs and usability. The design should also be helpful for those who are seeking help.</p>

																<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
																<p>Our scope is to develop an interactive app which is about mental health. We want that the app is well designed in terms of usability, it should have good page layouts and design patterns, sections and buttons to meet users’ needs. We also need to set up a payment method like Paypal and some other to meet the payment criteria.</p>
   															<p>We got some limitations though, in terms of group meetings, time and skills. Firstly, due to Covid-19, group members cannot meet face to face so we are doing online meetings. Again for the online meetings, we are trying to do the best to meet with each other but there are some issues like some of the  group members are living outside of Australia and some of us are living in rural areas so they may have bad internet connection from time to time. Secondly, because of the time frame that we are supposed to submit some other assignments for other courses as well, it is really hard for us to spend a substantial time on the design. Lastly, because of the skill deficiencies such as programming, limited knowledge about HTML Css, Javascript, Php etc,, it is hard to develop an interactive website at this stage. Although we already did some basic websites before by using Html and css, we have not done much with the javascript component. For this reason, we may need to take some professional advice, or we may need to try things out to better our web design skills but this brings the time issue again. Because of the limitations mentioned above, we want to focus on prototyping for the moment. Along with the prototype, we will do a group report and will explain the project.</p>
   															<p>At the end of our group work, we want to produce a medium or high fidelity prototype of the app. Figma has been used for the design. The prototype includes a login page, a short survey to know the patient better. Then, the main page is shown and it includes the main sections such as booking a consultation, current bookings and past consultation history. In addition, some buttons like settings and payments are shown in the main page at the bottom navigation. Prototype also includes a list that shows the health professionals including a short information about them and when you click on it, the user is directed to the page that shows their bibliographies related to what they do in the health industry.
																In addition to the prototype, we will also produce a group report in Pdf format that includes the information about our group members, project description, and the information about the group meetings. We will also do a website version of the report that is related to the report.</p>
   															<p>Our project is about setting up an app that will provide online consultation for patients that have mental health problems. This also gives an opportunity for the doctors who want to do extra work or who want to help the people. But, if we have the opportunity in terms of time and skills, we may want to add some other features in our project.</p>
   															<p>In terms of the industry that the project is related to, we can broaden the border and it can be a huge application that helps the patients and health professionals from all kinds of health sectors to meet for consultation and treatment. Of course, most of the time, doctors need to see the patients face to face and may need to touch the patients to detect problems, but there are also other times or other kinds of treatments and consultations that patients and doctors do not necessarily need to meet face to face to do what they need to do. So, this project can be also a good opportunity for those kinds of times.</p>

																			<h2>Risks</h2>
																			<p>For our project which would involve making a working application and service that aims to help and provide users with help and appropriate services available, it is important to think about the risks that might come up during and after development of the project. Developing a software for our project means that we need to learn how to use applications that would enable us to work on and produce a final product. Applications such as Appy Pie, Figma, and Lucid chart just to name a few would require us to take time and learn and maximize what these applications can do for our project and there would be no guarantee that the development would me smooth sailing as some might find it hard to get used to using a certain software development application for our project. Furthermore, coding or programming languages such as html, CSS, and JavaScript would also be taken into consideration as otherwise one team member has lots of experience coding maybe one or two programming language, it would still make a potential impact to the final product as not all members are experts immediately to all the programming language that the group decided to use. In addition, our project will utilize a questionnaire or survey for users which is then used for the recommended services and psychologists that is best suited for them. For this feature to function and work properly vital research and background is needed especially for recommending the right psychologist for a user and that poses a potential risk if our project or final product does not deliver or recommend a right one based on the user preferences. It would be difficult and a big risk in recommending the right service that is fitting to a user and definitely needs a lot of trial and error and testing for it to function properly which is also dependent on the user feedback.

																				<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
																				<p>Group communication was the most important factor that allowed us to produce us something for the last assignment, and it was also some sort of misunderstanding or bad communication that made us lose some marks for the last assignment. So this time, we tried to do better meetings. We have met as a group approximately twice a week on MS Teams. But it was not limited to MS teams that our group communicated on. We needed to use Discord for messaging. Whenever we needed to ask something, we sent messages on Discord instantly. So it really helped us in terms of communication and to set meetings on MS teams.</p>
 																				<p>Our primary meetings were held on MS Teams, although we frequently have used Discord. MS Teams was so helpful because we were able to see each other, ask and answer questions faster without waiting to be responded to our messages. MS teams also helped us in terms of that everyone was focusing on a single topic so that we resolved the problems or issues better and quicker. Last one was Collaborate Ultra that we used for group meetings mainly after the pracs. So with that, we communicated 4 or 5 days a week with each other.</p>
   																			<p>For the last assignment, we had someone in the group who had never communicated with us. For this reason, we tried to email him, called him on MS Teams and even tried to write something on the discussion page at Canvas, but it did not help so we let our lecturer know about the issue. Luckily for this assignment, everyone did well in terms of communication, but if we had someone who was not communicating, we would do the same things.</p>
