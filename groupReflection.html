							<h3>Nick Malzacher</h3>
								<p> Our group was very good at time management, we set deadlines of when work should be done and all group members participated equally and to a high level of standard. Moreover, our group members were very open and friendly and very easy to remain in contact with. We all arrived at the meeting times on time and recorded them all successfully. We also learned how to record and edit these recordings. Furthermore, we learned how to work on github as a team and how to push editings on github. </p>
								<p> One issue that I believe our group had was having open discussions and productive / coll;aborative meetings. I believe that this was highly due to the apparent hesitation of group members to provide input and participate. This was likely due to a large number of the group being introverted and hesitant to participate and talk. However, all group members participated equally and finished their work on time. </p>
								<p> One thing that was surprising was the ability for us as a group to come together after having a rocky start. Initially, we lacked communication through MS Teams, however when having our first group meeting everyone opened up and became open to group discussion, which allowed for good group synergy and all tasks to be completed on time by all members of the group. </p>
								<p> Working in a group enabled each of us to find value in working and helping together to accomplish tasks and the main assignment itself. One of the things I learned about working in this group is the importance of adapting to and having a quick problem solve in situations that come up on the spot or chasing time. As a group, we started a bit late in working on the assignment with circumstances that are unavoidable such as medical reasons and a group member that didn’t actively show participation and interest in the group. Luckily, we each adapted to the situation which is important and discussed thoroughly what we need to do to make up for the lost time and pump out work and try to finish tasks within a set deadline. Adaptability is something that I learned about working in this group as each of us regardless of time constraints and other problems, we all adapted well and tried our best to finish our respective tasks without sacrificing the quality of our content.</p>

								<p> Everyone in the group was pretty humble and they always did what they needed to do. Their attitudes towards each other’s opinions were perfect.</p>
								<p> In terms of improvement, I can say that it would be better if we could start doing the assignment earlier, so that we could have produced maybe a better job, but it is understandable because everyone was struggling to complete their assignments for some other subjects.</p>
								<p> Before starting to do the assignment, I thought it may be very hard to finish the assignment, but I am a bit surprised how being a group together really helps with completing a work when everyone is doing their tasks.</p>
								<p> After doing two assignments with a group, I have learned that the very important factor for a group work is having good communication with each other. Furthermore, beside making sure that you are doing well in terms of what you need to do, but you also need to make sure that you are doing well in terms of what else you can do for other members and for the project that you are working on.</p>

						  <p> The communication between our group went well, especially in Discord and MS teams where we productively discussed our assignment 3. In addition, our time management was effective in that each group member completed their responsibilities for assignment 3 to the best quality that they could manage.
						<br><br>
							Improvements could be made where each group member could work collaboratively on each task in assignment 3, instead of dividing the tasks for individual responsibility. Although we gave some feedback on other member’s tasks, I feel like collaboration for each task could have been more effective.
						<br><br>
							A thing that was surprising was that the tasks turned out to be more difficult than expected for my part. In addition, imputing the information and pushing it on the groups GitHub repository took longer than expected.
							<br><br>
							One thing that I have learned that communication is key and it is best if the group started the assignment early to avoid stressful situations later on in regards to the completion of the assignment.

							<p> What went well with our group is that everyone did their part well and on time and communication between group members through Microsoft Teams and Discord is superb. In the first few meetings that we scheduled as a group regarding the start and planning of our assignment 3, everyone was keen on their assigned roles that were chosen or chosen by themselves and there were no issues regarding on what we needed to work on. </p>
							<p> What could be improved though is that we could have taken advantage of an earlier time to start and working on the assignment. This would allow all of us to plan and start earlier than when we initially started which would enable us to possibly do a better job in our sections and produce a better outcome albeit all group members are busy with their other commitments be it university or personal life. Moreover, we could also improve on our communication a bit in general as when we edit and add new content or update our file in GitHub simultaneously, two or more people do it at the same time which often makes for loss of data due to miscommunication.</p>
							<p> Personally, one thing that was surprising in working with my group is how well we communicate and produce and finish our work despite the lack of time or last-minute changes. </p>
							<p> One thing I learned about groups is communication is always key regardless of any problems that arise during a project. Working with groups means that you are working with other people that can help you and vice versa which means that asking and communicating well would allow all group members to fulfill their own duties and tasks successfully which in turn benefits all members.</p>

							<p> Overall, the group project for A3 went way better than I initially expected. We as a group were able to rectify a lot of our issues we had when we initially gathered. The group for the most part had a pretty friendly and collaborative mood which helped exacerbate the progress and pushed us in finishing this project. Lastly, we all were able to communicate and collaborate as a team effectively using Github. </p>							
							<p>One slight caveat I had noticed was even though we were communicating pretty effectively was because a good number of us are introverts some members had difficulty in voicing out themselves during group discussions. While it was minor and overall did not affect our progress by much it is something we can do greatly to improve on. </p>
							<p> Something surprising about this was how well some of the prototypes and tables turned out. The prototype mock is way beyond what I initially expected we would be able to put out. We were able to make it fully interactive and an example of what we hoped we would be able to put out in the future. </p>
							<p> What I learned from the groups is the importance of initiative and responsibility needed to bring a  group of strangers together and make the work effectively on a massive project on the spot. This helped me better understand how to work with different groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures. It has been a great learning experience for me.  </p>
