							<h3> What went well? </h3>
							<p> At the beginning, the assignment seemed like a very huge amount of work. But, after we shared what we need to do for the assignment, we realized that it was something doable with the help of each group member. Our group members were friendly, we were usually in contact with each other. We learned how to schedule a meeting on MS Teams. We also learned how to record and edit these recordings. Furthermore, we learned how to work on github as a team and how to push editings on github. </p>
							<h3> What could be improved? </h3>
							<p>We had quite a few issues with setting a schedule and committing to it at the beginning of the project. This is a major issue we can do well to improve when tackling the next major assignment. The second major issue we can do well to improve on is our communication which was quite poor at the beginning of the assignment however it greatly improved by the end.</p>
							<h3> What did you find surprising?  </h3>
							<p> One thing that was surprising was the ability for us as a group to come together after having a rocky start. Initially, we lacked communication through MS Teams, however when having our first group meeting everyone opened up and became open to group discussion, which allowed for good group synergy and all tasks to be completed on time by all members of the group. </p>
							<h3> What is one thing that you have learned about groups? </h3>
							<p> Working in a group enabled each of us to find value in working and helping together to accomplish tasks and the main assignment itself. One of the things I learned about working in this group is the importance of adapting to and having a quick problem solve in situations that come up on the spot or chasing time. As a group, we started a bit late in working on the assignment with circumstances that are unavoidable such as medical reasons and a group member that didn’t actively show participation and interest in the group. Luckily, we each adapted to the situation which is important and discussed thoroughly what we need to do to make up for the lost time and pump out work and try to finish tasks within a set deadline. Adaptability is something that I learned about working in this group as each of us regardless of time constraints and other problems, we all adapted well and tried our best to finish our respective tasks without sacrificing the quality of our content.</p>
							<h3>GitHub Log and Activities</h3>
							<p> At the start of the assignment, setting up the group GitHub did not take long. We allocated one person to organize and set up the GitHub repository and page. The log of activities on GitHub reflects the group’s work well as everyone contributed to editing the group’s website. The meetings held in MS teams were beneficial and allowed us to discuss and work on the group’s website in real time, and to get solutions to unanswered questions. Overall, although we started late on getting all the content on GitHub, the collaboration went smoothly and towards the submission deadline as everyone was aware of what they needed to accomplish. </p>
