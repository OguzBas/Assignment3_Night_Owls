								<p> Everyone in the group was pretty humble and they always did what they needed to do. Their attitudes towards each otherâ€™s opinions were perfect.</p>
								<p>	In terms of improvement , I can say that it would be better if we could start doing the assignment earlier, so that we could have produced maybe a better job, but it is understandable because everyone was struggling to complete their assignments for some other subjects.</p>
								<p> Before starting to do the assignment, I thought it may be very hard to finish the assignment, but I am a bit surprised how being a group together really helps with completing a task when everyone is doing their tasks.</p> 
								<p>After doing two assignments with a group, I have learned that the very important factor for a group work is having good communication with each other. Furthermore, beside making sure that you are doing well in terms of what you need to do, but you also need to make sure that you are doing well in terms of what else you can do for other members and for the project that you are working on.</p>
