							<h3>Nick Malzacher</h3>
								<p> Our group was very good at time management, we set deadlines of when work should be done and all group members participated equally and to a high level of standard. Moreover, our group members were very open and friendly and very easy to remain in contact with. We all arrived at the meeting times on time and recorded them all successfully. We also learned how to record and edit these recordings. Furthermore, we learned how to work on github as a team and how to push editings on github. </p>
								<p> One issue that I believe our group had was having open discussions and productive / coll;aborative meetings. I believe that this was highly due to the apparent hesitation of group members to provide input and participate. This was likely due to a large number of the group being introverted and hesitant to participate and talk. However, all group members participated equally and finished their work on time. </p>
								<p> One thing that was surprising was the ability for us as a group to come together after having a rocky start. Initially, we lacked communication through MS Teams, however when having our first group meeting everyone opened up and became open to group discussion, which allowed for good group synergy and all tasks to be completed on time by all members of the group. </p>
								<p> Working in a group enabled each of us to find value in working and helping together to accomplish tasks and the main assignment itself. One of the things I learned about working in this group is the importance of adapting to and having a quick problem solve in situations that come up on the spot or chasing time. As a group, we started a bit late in working on the assignment with circumstances that are unavoidable such as medical reasons and a group member that didn’t actively show participation and interest in the group. Luckily, we each adapted to the situation which is important and discussed thoroughly what we need to do to make up for the lost time and pump out work and try to finish tasks within a set deadline. Adaptability is something that I learned about working in this group as each of us regardless of time constraints and other problems, we all adapted well and tried our best to finish our respective tasks without sacrificing the quality of our content.</p>

								<p> Everyone in the group was pretty humble and they always did what they needed to do. Their attitudes towards each other’s opinions were perfect.</p>
								<p> In terms of improvement, I can say that it would be better if we could start doing the assignment earlier, so that we could have produced maybe a better job, but it is understandable because everyone was struggling to complete their assignments for some other subjects.</p>
								<p> Before starting to do the assignment, I thought it may be very hard to finish the assignment, but I am a bit surprised how being a group together really helps with completing a work when everyone is doing their tasks.</p>
								<p> After doing two assignments with a group, I have learned that the very important factor for a group work is having good communication with each other. Furthermore, beside making sure that you are doing well in terms of what you need to do, but you also need to make sure that you are doing well in terms of what else you can do for other members and for the project that you are working on.</p>
