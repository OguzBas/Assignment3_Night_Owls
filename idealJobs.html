As an Analyst, Nicholas will have to test a system to ensure that it is impenetrable, whereas Jerry will have to analyse possible vulnerabilities within a system (Difference Between a Security Analyst and a Security Engineer? - SSI, 2020). </p>

							<p> Ahlyk and Youthtakak both aim to pursue working as developers.

Ahlyk’s role as a Software and Application developer involves him designing and constructing systems or applications that fit the need of its target user or its goal.

However these careers have many differences, whilst Nick and Jerry aim to work in cybersecurity to help safeguard information and data using technical and logical skills, Ahlyk and Youthakak aim to work as developers which involve retrieving, storing, and manipulating data. Their skills and knowledge differ from Nick and Jerry as they need to have organizational and team-working skills. Oguz aspires to work as an IT coordinator which shares similarities with the other group members' ideal career, as it similarly involves the need for programming and problem-solving skills. </p>
