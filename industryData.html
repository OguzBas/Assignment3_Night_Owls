							It has somewhat changed my perspective in an ideal job as it made me reconsider the programming languages that I should learn for example SQL, which is an IT skill highest in demand in the bar chart given by Burning Glass. However, given that JavaScript and project management are valued highly by employers, full stack software development would still be a lucrative job for years to come. In addition, full stack software developer is a top title within Australia and New Zealand therefore it is still considered an ideal job for me. </p>
