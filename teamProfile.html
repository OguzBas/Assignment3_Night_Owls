							<p></p>
							<h3>Personal Information</h3>
							<p>My name is Nicholas Malzacher and I am currently undergoing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT City. I was previously studying a Bachelor of Business (Human Resources Management) however during the second semester of my second year, I decided I wanted to pursue Cyber Security. My hobbies include playing video-games such as Call of Duty and Overwatch, going to the gym and spending time with both my friends and partner. In regards to IT i enjoy the idea of cyber security and ethical hachicking. However, Prior to starting IT, I have had minimal experience in coding and coding languages.</p>
							<h3>The test outcomes</h3>
							<p>As shown by the Myers Briggs Test, my personality type is an ESTP-T. ESTP-T are individuals whose strengths involve being rational and practical, perceptive and sociable. In regard to working within a group these attributes will assist in taking change and being able to discuss, develop and guide effective progress to be made. Moreover, the Online Learning Style test deemed that I am a visual learner. This will support my group as I will be able to visualise what our group will need to-do in order to effectively manage and finish our assignment. Lastly, the big 5 personality test has indicated that my top 3 attributes are openness, extraversion and agreeableness. As explored by Corinna E. Löckenhoff¹, the strong attributes of openness, extraversion and agreeableness suit the role of an individual in management as they are able to effectively communicate, visualise and predict what must be done within a given timeframe. With this in mind, I suggest I find individuals who are open minded and are open to discussion and differing opinions to allow for different views and perspectives to be explored.</p>

							<p></p>
							<h3>Personal Information</h3>
							<p>My name is Ahlyk Xandyr Beredo (Student number s3781189) and I was born and raised in the Philippines. I finished up my primary and high-school years upto year 10 in 2016 and arrived and started living in Melbourne mid-2016.

							<h3>The test outcomes</h3>
							<p>Myers-Briggs Test<br>
							The results of my Myers-Briggs test show that I have an INFJ or an "advocate" personality type. This personality type is regarded as rare as stated in the test website making up one percent of the whole population which means that for me this fits well with my actions, thoughts, and opinions generally speaking which I tend to try my best to see through my goals whilst having an important and lasting impact not only to myself but to other people as well.<br>
							Learning Style<br>
							Based on the learning style test I'm more of a pragmatist style learner, meaning that I need to be able to see how I could utilise what I've learned into practise in the real world. I like trying out new ideas and experimenting on it to test if it works or not. My other secondary, tertiary, and quaternary learning styles namely theorist, reflector, and activist respectively. This result of my learning style would influence my behaviour on a team as I learn through trying out new ideas and work well in discussions so I would be able to take advantage and learn from others as well in trying to complete a task.<br>
							Big Five Factors<br>
							The results from my big five factors show that agreeableness which is factor 3, is my highest raw score compared to the other factors. This means that I am friendly and optimistic which is a trait that is very useful especially when working with people in a team. My second highest raw score is factor 4 which is conscientiousness, which tells me that I am an individual who is careful and diligent which allows me to not recklessly decide on what to do with tasks especially under pressure. My third highest raw score is factor 1 which is extroversion. It remarks that people like me who score high on this factor are outgoing and social which is a good attribute to have in working with a team as I will not have too much of a problem interacting or introducing myself to my teammates and teammates would be able to easily approach me.</p>
