						<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
						<h3>What does it do? </h3>
						<p>Cyber security refers to the practise of safeguarding technology such as servers, computers, networks and electronic systems from breaches of data and malicious attacks. As defined by RAND, “the state-of-the-art in cyber security refers to the overview of flagrant risks, threats or policy issues that occur within the field of cybersecurity, as well as issue areas that are perceived to be overlooked by programmers or relevant communities. (Rand, 2019)” Moreover, Fifth Domain deliberates that there are two main phases in regard to the state of art in cyber security. Phase one involves the scanning of the cybersecurity field in order to identify and understand the threats presented. Whereas, the second phase refers to the action that is taken in response to combat the given threat (Fifth Domain, 2019). </p>
							<p>Cyber Security as of current, is largely abundant within all large organisations from banks, retailers and government organisations. Cyber security allows for businesses to have a safeguard on files, networks, firewalls and develop safety plans. Cyberattacks are ever changing and occur to organisations, customers and employees. As stated by Norton, these attacks may be created in the aims to destroy sensitive data and/or extort money (Norton 2020). Moreover, cyber security within businesses can provide multiple layers of protection within computers, devices, networks and programs. However, a strong cyber security system that possesses multiple layers of protection across computers, devices, networks and programs.</p>
								<p>As stated by Cisco, there are three main types of cyberthreats, these include attacks against confidentiality, integrity and availability (Cisco, 2018). Attacks against confidentiality refers to attacks that are intended to steal an individual's personal identity in the aims to steal banking or credit card information. Attacks on Integrity refers to individual or business-oriented sabotage, these are likely referred to as leaks. This is done in the aim to influence the public to lose trust / faith in a person and/or organisation. An attack on availability refers to an instance in which a user is blocked from accessing their own data and are held ransom until they paid a nominated fee. </p>
								<p>Moreover, the recent abundance of cloud technology, hardware authentication has played a significant role in the current advancements within the cyber security field. As the emergence of cloud base technology has become more abundant in recent times, the ability to share and store information remotely has made cybersecurity much stronger. The cloud has provided increased levels of security as it supplies both protections containing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, prevention technology and anti-penetration technology (ECPI, 2018). </p>
								<p>Additionally, hardware authentication has proved to allow for numerous advancements within the cyber security field. As explored by ECPI, “Intel is now using this technology where it combines a variety of hardware-enhanced factors simultaneously to validate a user’s identity” (ECPI, 2018). This in turn has strengthened the cyber security front as it maximises the information needed in order for a cyberthreat to have access to information. </p>
								<p>As the notion of ‘cyber security’ becomes more prevalent the use of machine learning and AI may grow alongside. The introduction of this will allow for the detection and alerting to organisations of potential cyberattacks. These advancements are also predicted to scan for ransomware which will limit the number of potential cyber-attacks. Adding to this, Forcepoint Cyber security, predicts that organisations will begin to shift from the use of breach indicators of compromise to the use of indicators of behaviour as malware and threats will become more advanced (Forcepoint, 2020). </p>

						<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
						<p>As the field of cyber security grows as a whole, the threat of cyber-attacks grows alongside. As a result, the number of people in the cyber security field will significantly increase. As the New York Times predicts that “by 2021 there will be over 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions, up from just one million in early 2014” (New York Times, 2018). In agreeance with this, Justin Lawrence, from Yale University believes that the cyber security field will grow at a rate of 33.2% by 2028 as the number of cybersecurity crimes grow at a marginal rate. (CampusYale, 2019). </p>
							<p>Attila Tomascheck, a Cyber Security Researcher at Pro Privacy hypothesises that the future of cyber security will strongly rely on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Tomascheck, elaborates that IoT and connected devices are growing at a burgeoning rate. He states that the ways in which we leave ourselves exposed to potential cyber-attacks continue to increase rapidly, as a result, human oriented systems do not have the capabilities to keep up with the ever-growing threats that are presented by these cyber threats (Disruptor Daily, 2020). </p>
								<p>This begs the question of the future of cyber security. As it stands many believe that the shortcoming future, presents a large number of prospect for people within the cyber security field, yet Tomascheck, foresees that the number of jobs within the industry will likely decline in the distant future as many, if not all positions will be replaced with AI intelligence which can regulate and monitor data and informational breaches. </p>

						<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
						<p>The prominence of ‘cyber security’ is highly beneficial for all individuals regardless of the level of internet use, as it protects your personal information, files and the stealing and selling or your personal information. Cyber Security, in day to day life protects my digital data through my network, safeguards my computer and devices from unauthorised users and access, attack and/or destruction. </p>
							<p>With this, the prevalence of cyber security threats will decrease as methods to minimise the potential data breaches will emerge and limit the threat to all. With this data, whether deemed important or not, lost or stolen can provide attackers with information which can be used to create phishing campaigns (make a fake identity) which can later be used to take out loans in your name, have your identity stolen or compromise your online accounts that rely on security questions. This can affect family and friends although is most common within the older generations (personally, my grandma). Moreover, this information can then be bought and provided to advertisers (ZDNET, 2020)</p>

							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
							<h3>What does it do? </h3>
							<p>The idea of machine learning comes from problems and difficulties that programmers have to solve or produce new algorithms to overcome these problems. If the problem is simple, it may not be hard for people to create algorithms. But, when it is a complex problem, it may take a long time to solve the problems and it may not be very accurate for the situation. The introduction of artificial intelligence now allows scientists and programmers to use a computer program to come up with new algorithms. This is called machine learning. And the current technology allows us to have really smart robots and machinery which can use artificial intelligence. </p>
								<p>Machine learning is basically the term given to the study of computers interacting with the outside world and coming up with new algorithms by itself. It focuses on experience to improve new algorithms then it uses that algorithms and uses data to have better experience and better algorithms. Machine learning is also called the study that allows the machines to bring up new algorithms without explicitly programmed. It is artificial intelligence that allows machines to be able to produce algorithms. Artificial intelligence can analyse big data very fast and it can give us more accurate outputs than people. So, we can say that machine learning is quicker and more accurate. It is this intelligence that allows the machine to make predictions and decide. </p>
									<p>When it comes to the environment where a computer program learns and how it learns, there are 3 main types of learning for the computer, although it is not restricted to these 3 types. First one is supervised learning. In the supervised learning, the computer is already given an input and shown which output to produce according to the input. Then, by this experience computers learn a general rule which it applies when mapping between inputs and outputs. And when it encounters with a different input it uses the rules that it already knows to produce the predicted outputs. Second type of learning is unsupervised learning. In the unsupervised learning, computers are not given any structure or rules. It is left with the environment alone and it is supposed to produce an algorithm by checking the inputs it has already got. So, this time the computer looks for pre-existing data which is not labelled or grouped. Then, the computer groups that data and tries to find a pattern according to the environment. Here is where the computer uses artificial intelligence. </p>
									<p>The third type of machine learning is reinforcement learning. Here, a computer is placed in an environment where it is supposed to do a certain task. Like the unsupervised learning, the computer is not given any pre-labelled data or structured data. Instead, computers are supposed to check pre-existing data and find a pattern to apply to the environment. It will, then, find some data and produce a pattern that it will compare with the environment. After comparing data and environment, it will find a balance and produce a new algorithm.</p>

							<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
							<p>As we are living in the robot era, artificial intelligence and machine learning definitely has a significant importance. We have already started using them. As an example, self-driving cars developed by using machine learning. Likewise, we search for something specific on the internet or when we watch a video on Youtube, the search engine will, then, suggest similar videos to watch or similar information to look for. We also get advantage of machine learning in the industries like banking, healthcare, retail and many more as a very strong alternative to the human brain. Now, it is inevitable that machine learning and artificial intelligence will introduce us more products to use in our homes, in education or in other areas. Machine learning will potentially impact our lives more in the near future. It already produced many robots, but these robots will be more common by the time. </p>
								<p>As people are slower than computers, computers will be able to produce more accurate products faster than humans. This means our problems will be solved faster and we would be able to produce better products. Until now, we used machinery to help us with labouring. Now, we can use computers to help us think, to help us solve problems and come up with new ideas. Literally, everything that happens in our environment can potentially change. However, it seems that machine learning is likely to change the technology and digital area mostly. It will produce new machinery to deal with our daily tasks such as lifting, cleaning and many more. It will also likely produce smarter mobile phone applications, games and some other applications to help us with cybersecurity. </p>
									<p>Potentially, machine learning and AI will affect most of us positively and some of us negatively. If we start with the negative side, as the computers do more jobs in terms of thinking and labour, people do less work. It means we will work less and think less. So, computers are replacing human activity. New inventions may affect young people and students negatively leaving them less work and less thinking and that may make them lazy. On the other hand, AI will produce more accurate products for the working people like doctors, police, teachers, and other workers. It will also help the elderly in terms of daily tasks. It will potentially change many jobs. By having complex and smart machinery, labouring load may reduce. As long as a machine can do what people do, people will be doing less job and this will reduce their working hours. Also, people will need to deal with technology more to adapt themselves to the new applications. Potentially, there will be more need for the technicians, and for the programmers. </p>

							<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
							<p>In our daily lives, especially if we are using the technology frequently and if we are working, we will get most of the advantage of machine learning and AI. Because as discussed above, AI will potentially affect the technology mostly, so we will be using smarter applications and programs. It means our daily tasks will be done easily. Our problems will be solved faster. As computers will help programmers and developers to come up with more accurate software and algorithms. Especially, developers do lots of surveys to get feedback from users, and if we can adapt computers to the user experience environment, this will also be helpful in terms of correcting mistakes and developing better applications. </p>
								<p>I am personally very hopeful and curious about machine learning. Because, computers can now suggest very intelligent products to us which is fantastic. I hope, in the near future, I will be using smart home cleaners, better applications, fantastic cars which can adapt the drive according to road and weather conditions. On the other hand, I feel like my thinking activity is not as active as before now. Because, computers can suggest very smart options which are hard to reject which make me think less and act less. </p>
								<p>My family will definitely be affected by the improvements. For example, my brother is working in a construction company and if the computers can produce new machinery that can do what workers do, my brother may need to find another job, he may work less. Furthermore, my mother is getting older and in teen years she may not be able to do her house work, so if the computers can produce new home appliances, it will be perfect. So, I am hopeful and suspicious about what machine learning will come up with next. <p>

									<h2>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</h2>
									<h3>What does it do? </h3>
									<p>Natural Language Processing or NLP for short is how computers and other devices such as Siri, Google Home, and Amazon's Alexa communicate with us. Without it, most chatterbots provide any real, meaningful uses. NLP is a sub-branch of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with how a computer processes enormous amounts of language data and it's context's and being able to understand it. In layman's terms, with the ability of computers having interactions with humans that can analyse and understand then act upon human language inputs. </p>
										<p>Natural Language Processing accomplishes an extraordinary feat as it takes unstructured human language data and breaks it down to a structured data it will be able to interpret. Humans take communication usually for granted as most do not realise how absurdly complicated and varied it can be. There are near countless ways one may be able to express themself verbally and through human body language and in writing. Natural Language Processing is crucial as it has helped resolve the ambiguity in language moreover adds valuable numeric structure to the data for many more applications, such as speech recognition or text analytics. </p>
											<p>Natural Language Processing does this breakdown through the uses of a variety of techniques for understanding Human language ranging from the use of the machine and statistical learning methods to algorithmic and rule-based approaches. The reason there is a need for such a wide array of techniques is due to the varied nature of the text and voice-based data. The standard method of NLP tasks includes the use of tokenisation and parsing, lemmatisation/ stemming, part-of-speech tagging, language detection and identification of semantic relationships. It is comparable to how teachers in elementary diagrammed sentences of children on how to structure sentences. </p>
											<p>Most may not realise it, but there are numerous examples of Natural Language Processing in our daily lives. This is not just limited to Amazon Echo or Google Echo; it is found under the hood such as Siri when you ask her to send a text message or create an event on a calendar using voice commands only through Natural Language Processing we accomplish that. Some more examples of its use in applications Auto-correct found in phones, PCs, & Laptops, Spam-filter for email find keywords or phrases alerting the system to dump the mail as spam, and lastly Business chatterbots that can answer simple questions and direct customers to where they can find more detailed answers. </p>

									<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
									<p>We are currently in an era dominated by communication and the ability to share data over the internet instantaneously. Where over hundreds of millions of users online at any time. Out of those millions of users, there will be sure to be several million in need of help online, and there are not enough call centres and on-hand personnel to assist all of those users. With the rise of Ai Chatterbots and its implementation in several different businesses such as Bank assistance, Shopping assistance. It improves user interaction prompting them to stay longer than a conventional site. We have arrived at a point where not too far into the future we will see the mass implementation of highly intelligent AIs that can converse with humans to an impressive degree.  </p>
										<p>An area where there is a tremendous impact is in the medical community. With machine learning the potential to have the massive effects here is enormous. This would be a great boon to people with a cognitive disability or a speech deficiency as this will help those people better communicate with others around them. One more area would be in interpreting sing language from a deaf person and translate it to words for someone who can not do sign language. </p>

									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>This would affect me greatly because I can see the potential of Natural Language Learning to help those with speech deficiencies and in particular children. My brother was born as a special child and has language problems. This would help tremendously as the AI can analyse his particular language and speech behaviour and over time can help teachers understand better and know how to communicate and teach him in the most appropriate manner.  </p>
										<p>In daily life, I can see myself speaking directly into my ear phone and asking my AI assistant to log or create a schedule at any time of the day. This would greatly improve my productivity and help keep me on schedule. This would basically be an AI assistant and would do most of the most mundane tasks we would not need to bother again in the future. This would be a great boon for techies like myself as it would become a great asset.  </p>
										<p>For my friends and family I can see a degree where some would embrace it others not bother it and some in the middle. This is an amazing technology when it gets developed to a further point but also brings with it great risk. Such as if you give authority to your AI assistant it can do paying the bills and other e-taks, however if someone can circumvent the security that person has unrestricted access to all your private information and bank details. In the end this is a double edged sword. </p>

											<h2>Clouds, services, servers</h2>
											<h3>What does it do? </h3>
											<p>Storing data and information is essential especially with the widespread use of the internet and technology as a whole in our society. With the accumulation and usage of various hardware and software services, it is important to store the data and information somewhere for storage and that’s where cloud services and servers come in. The Cloud including its services allows data to be sent or transmitted and then stored on remote systems which is then backed up and managed which makes it accessible to users through a network such as the internet. This technology allows users to backup and store their data and not worry about just having the data stored locally in their respective devices. This service allows the user to access what they stored in the cloud and modify or save it from another device which is convenient especially for businesses and everyday users. What can currently be done now for cloud services is to improve the efficiency and restoration of massive scale backups involving a lot of data. As for servers, what can currently be done now is improving its stability. Most of the time public servers go down because of high usage or traffic, and companies who operate with the servers could add stability and fix and reduce downtimes such as optimizing the database and using reliable, fast web hosts. Furthermore, cloud services rely on the internet bandwidth and rated cloud storage speed which means that if anything goes wrong with it, backup and restoring a server or obtaining any data stored in the cloud would be delayed and slowed down which would drastically affect the reliability of the cloud. What is likely to be done soon is that there is a likely increase in storage capacity in the cloud and with it brings cheaper costs. As business and the general population rely more and more in storing their data be it company records and business logs and transactions to simple family photos and important documents, the cloud storage and services is moving to normalization. Moreover, more cloud services would likely be developed or improved on by new technology companies or existing tech giants such as Amazon. In terms of what technological or other developments that make this possible are factors such as improved internet speeds. As the internet becomes more and more fast and reliable, it would enable cloud services to function and improve on effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, the improvement of security would also make this possible as scenarios such as data breaches would significantly impact the reliability of the cloud and improving the security of data stored within their respective hosts and servers would drastically benefit it. As for servers, technological advancements such as the creation of more powerful and reliable hardware to manage that makes up a server. </p>

											<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
											<p>The potential impact in the further development of cloud service is that it would allow for businesses or companies and the general population who utilise the cloud to rely on the cloud for their data to be stored. As the cloud becomes more reliable, safe, and efficient in storing even large quantities of data, it would likely become the new normal in data storage as it is a service that can be accessed by users in multiple platforms and the idea that their data be it in the form of photos or documents be accessed anywhere anytime when stored in the cloud would increase its usage. As a result of this, the way we store data through other means such as physical external USB devices or hard drives would drastically be affected. Through cloud a user can access his or her data anywhere as long as he or she is connected to the internet which is also one of the factors that is becoming more and more widespread and used and improved upon, therefore as the internet becomes more widely available and through advances such as the development of 5G networks where phones can access the internet faster anywhere as long as they are in the radius of cell or network towers, physical external storage devices would most likely be used less often as it is better to access your stored data without bringing or limited to having the external device where the user stored the data. Moreover the backing up of data is also appealing as the restoration of data stored with it would not be easily lost in comparison to having an external device which if dropped or misplaced, there is a chance that data stored exclusively inside is forever lost.  In relation to cloud services, servers would also become more and more utilised to store data from the cloud. People such as those who run companies and businesses who rely and collect loads of data and information from their clients would be most affected by this development. It would affect them as their company or business heavily relies on the accumulation of client data and the positive development of both cloud service and servers would allow their company or business to function efficiently such as banks or hospitals that rely on their databases or data from their clients to be effectively stored and pulled up when needed. As mentioned above although not anytime soon as both have their positives and negative aspects, the development of cloud services and servers would likely affect the use of external storage devices such as hard drives or USB’s. If the development of cloud services and servers keep on going which improves their reliability and effectiveness in storing data from anywhere anytime using internet connected devices as well as effective data backups to avoid loss of data, the need for external storage would likely decrease as mentioned, where people can just get the data they saved without carrying around an external device is really appealing. </p>

											<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
											<p> In my personal daily life, the improvement and advances in cloud services and server technology would drastically enable me to use services that rely on the cloud or use the cloud service itself to be used and trusted more. Due to the advancements in the overall efficiency and reliability of the cloud, services I use such as Google drive or Microsoft One Plus to store the documents and photos for personal and school related work would see an increase of use.  If the development of the cloud and servers would be improved upon what will be different for me is that I would likely not use my external storage devices such as my hard drive in storing my photos when I backup my phone or save files and documents. As mentioned in the likely impact of the development of cloud services and servers, this advancement would most likely change how I store data and would change my perception and consider buying a subscription if available to increase my cloud storage and have its benefits. These developments might affect members in my family not as drastic compared with myself and my friends as it would probably take time especially for my older members of my family to get accustomed to utilising and committing to storing their data such as their pictures and documents to the cloud. They would most likely still use physical storage devices such as a family hard drive but also use the cloud if they choose to be educated and learn to use it. As mentioned, my friends depending on their own circumstances would likely move and adapt to using cloud services as adept as myself due to the familiarity of current technological advances and the exposure to its advantages. </p>
