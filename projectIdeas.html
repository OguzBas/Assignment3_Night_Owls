							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/projectidea.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>The project will consist of both a mobile and web application that would appeal to all age groups, focusing on app usability and efficiency to retrieve, store, track, and analyze user data. The app will be a professional online counselling platform that provides a low-cost alternative to face-to-face counselling through smartphones, personal computers, or tablets alike.

							Like professional counselling websites like BetterHelp.com and Talkspace.com, this project’s aim will be to help individuals who may be suffering from mental health issues, as well as reducing the mental health disparities in countries around the world. Both the mobile and web apps will be a platform where groups and individuals can seek help and track their progress for their mental health.

							Ultimately, the project considers several elements, including the tools and technology to create the app, the skills required to create the program, and the collaboration between several different non-technical and technical individuals to help develop the app. To name a few, these individuals include psychologists, psychotherapists, programmers, and UX designers to create an attractive interface for the user. </p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>Mental illness is a worldwide problem and has long been something that many people have been trying to combat, especially since the rise of the use of technological devices such as smartphones and personal computers. Now that the coronavirus pandemic occurred, more people are staying home more than ever, albeit with their family, friends or by themselves. With staying at home, people’s activities on social media and online platforms are increasing, meaning more screen time. This raises one main issue, which is how quarantine and the effects of the pandemic is affecting the mental health of people. According to the Journal of Medicine, the effects of public health emergencies on individuals and communities such as confusion, emotional isolation, and owing to economic loss “may translate into a range of emotional reactions”, such as distress and psychiatric conditions (Pfefferbaum and North 2020, p.510). In addition, it is estimated that 20.1 percent of Australians had a “mental or behavioral condition” in 2017 to 2018 (Cook 2019, para. 6). That is approximately five million Australians experiencing some sort of mental health condition.

							Reducing mental distress would not only positively impact the individual, but the economy as well. It is reported by KPMG and Mental Health Australia, that in 2018, mental ill health in the workplace costs anywhere from $3,200 to 5,600 per employee in the workplace (Cook 2019 Para 10). This suggests another underlying issue regarding how efficient employees are with getting tasks done.  Furthermore, this would affect the overall performance for employees working at a company.

							Providing easy access for help to people through web and mobile applications is an effective way to reduce mental distress, especially in places that don’t have available psychiatrists or where people are unable to afford an in-office therapy session. According to WHO, one psychiatrist is served per 100,000 people living in a country, within 45 percent of the world’s population back in 2014 (McPhillips, 2016). The mental health help application project allows psychiatrists to work from anywhere and help those from all over the world with access to the internet. Ultimately, the more psychiatrists and counsellors are available to serve people, the more healthy, stable, and well-rounded society and economy will become.</p>

							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>Upon starting the app, the user will receive a greeting from the app with the goal of making them feel welcomed. After, the user will be prompted to answer a series of questionnaires, instead of a sign-up page. If users already have an account, they can log-in from the front page. The reason for doing it this way is to prioritize the user’s intention in using the app and the help they might need first. For first time users of the app, the sign-up page will be presented after the user has answered all the questions required for an appropriate diagnosis.

							One of the first things that should be visible on the first page of the app is identifying the type of user that is seeking help. For example, individuals, couples, teens and children (under parental guidance), and corporate entities. This ensures that the app targets individuals and groups in society that are most prone to mental health. Once users has identified themselves in the category they fit in most, it will lead to a questionnaire that asks a series of questions regarding the demographic, psychographic, and geographic of the user such as Gender, Age, Relationship Status, Religious and Spiritual Beliefs, Past Experiences with Counseling and Therapy, Location, Preferred Language, etc. To add on, the survey would include questions regarding symptoms that may lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental problems. There will be an optional test for users to take such as the personality test or Big5 Test for counselors to gain insight on the user's personality and history to better help them.

							Other features would include elements like an efficient navigation bar that includes a FAQ, advice, reviews, about, and login page. For users that are data sensitive and wanting to feel more secure about their information, the mobile app will implement a facial recognition feature for all IOS devices with a front camera. After signing up and login in, the app will ask the user the type of counselor they would prefer and their expertise in fields such as depression, relationships, family conflict, trauma and abuse, and the like. The reason for this type of psychological testing is “to quantify and parse apart symptoms that are shared among disorders" where people may have several symptoms (Tartakovsky 2018, para. 12). Furthermore, the testing is to identify the type of help the users are seeking and to redirect them to a counselor best fit for their issue. Furthermore, the therapist can have an idea of which psychotherapy approach (if needed) would be most effective to the user’s need.

							The next feature is a 1-on-1 session through online communication. The user can choose to communicate through a fully encrypted Chatterbox, messaging room or a live chat session with their chosen counselor. The user can send video and audio recordings, upload files and documents, and call the therapist. The live chat session will be private and would require a passcode to enter for additional security. In the communication room, there will be two help features. The first help feature is an explanation of how the communication room works. The second help feature consists of a list of questions that the users may want to ask therapists or counsellors in case they do not know how to get started with the type of questions to ask. The duration of the session can be stopped at any time and the user can request to change therapist at any time.

							Another feature is a journaling space. This function provides a space for people to create journal entries. Within the journal entry, users can type, record, insert photos, and draw, allowing them to express their thoughts in different ways. The journal space will include an in-app scanner for journals that are handwritten, giving a choice for users who prefer to handwrite their journals but still want to log it into the app. Like the messaging feature, the journaling space will be encrypted, and users may have the choice to place in a password access for privacy reasons.

							The app also includes guided therapeutic exercises. The exercises are a form of meditation through breathing and visualization. Users can choose the type of exercise and the duration of 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. A reminder feature is available for users to set daily, weekly, or monthly reminders. In addition to this feature. There will be daily notification alerts available in the app. The number of notification alerts per day can be changed according to the user's preferences. This is one of the more important features of the app because it helps remind users of exercises, tasks, meetings with therapists, and progress reports etc. as people might be occupied with work, or simply forgetting to seek help. For example, depression, stress, and anxiety has been associated with short-term memory problems (Scaccia 2020). People with those conditions mentioned may be more susceptible to memory problems and forgetfulness. The daily notification alert would act as a mitigation to those problems.

							Lastly, to cover the costs of counsellors and therapists, there will be a subscription based payment of $40 weekly to access the full features of the app. Users can pay through PayPal, credit card, MasterCard, or AfterPay. The subscription cost may also be subsidized by the government, depending on the country. In Australia, the Australian government provides Medicare-subsidized mental health services for allied health professionals under the Better Access initiative (Cook 2019). Therefore, users with Medicare in Australia can be relieved of some financial burden. In further regards to payment, notice will be forwarded for inactiveness or unused payments for the services provided in the app.</p>

							<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
							<p> 1.) For Front-end development, two software will be used. Firstly is “Framework 7", which is a mobile and web development framework using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop IOS and Android apps.

							2.) Back-End Development: MySQL, which is an open-source relational database software will be used to manage user information. Eclipse will be used to program in Java.

							3.) ‘'VSCode’' Text editor to program for the front-end and back-end of the website. Specifically, the HTML and CSS will be written in VSCode. For JavaScript, ‘'buildfire.js’' will be used.

							4.)  “Sinch”, for integration of voice calls, video calls and SMS in the app.

							5.) For user interface design, “Animator By Haiku” will be used to create animations, geared towards children and teenage users of the app. “Figma” will be used to design the features included in the app. It is a collaborative, easy drag and drop function to make the design process of the app development more efficient.

							6.) Pigeon paywall, a plugin used to set up a paywall for paid content. </p>

							<h2>Skills Required</h2>
							<p>The skills required for building website and mobile application are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Framework 7. There are various accredited courses and masterclasses online where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be learned and are taught by experienced individuals. To use Animator by Haiku and Figma, some knowledge on digital design would be required. In addition, knowledge of user centered design is required for researching demographics and psychographics of users to identify their needs and wants for the app. To design an effective layout in the app, knowledge on mobile design, patterns, and testing. Additionally, knowing how to program in PHP for back-end purposes is required to use MySQL for managing user records. </p>

							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>A successful project means launching it on the App Store and Google Play Store, giving many smartphone users the access to the app. In addition, a website for the app will also be available to reach more internet users. This project solves the original problem of people unable to go to in-office counselling due to the high cost of therapy of $100-$150 per hour, in comparison to $40 weekly subscription, as well as eliminating the travel time for in-office counselling. The impact it would have on people’s mental health would be tremendous as more people are willing to get counselled due to the convenience and available access to help.

							Beyond using websites and mobile apps as platforms, the project could move to therapy and counselling sessions via integration of Virtual Reality, by collaborating with companies like VR Chat, which is a virtual reality platforms where users can create avatars, create worlds, play games, and interact with other players (Vrchat 2020). A room would be created for the counselling session with a counsellor, with the option of including other people with similar diagnoses. Within the room, the counsellor, or the person getting counselled may partake in activities that simulated real-life experiences. However, for this to work, a VR headset is needed for both the counsellor and the person seeking help and that doesn’t come cheap. Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 VR headset costs $299 per set, which is relatively expensive (Robertson 2020).  People may not be willing to invest this amount for the sake of counselling sessions, without guaranteed evidence that it is effective for mental health treatment. If the VR device is cheaper and there is science-backed research evidence of VR counselling, then this method may be effective in helping people experience face-to-face in-office counselling.

							Another possibility to improve the app to the next level is an AI-backed chatterbox that can give helpful responses based on the user’s data and progress when the therapists or counsellors are not available to communicate with the user at the given time.  </p> <hr>
