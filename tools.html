							<h2>Tools Used</h2>
							<p><strong>Google Document</strong> - Google Document was used as a platform for the group to compile the information required for assignment 3. Each group member had the responsibility to complete their tasks. Google Doc allows each group member to check and proofread their work and other group members as some tasks may overlap. </p>

							<p><strong>Discord </strong>- Discord is the main communication platform for the group. The group members are more active on Discord therefore any information, document, or files related to the assignment would be brought up on there. Information will also be sent to MS teams group chat in case a team member does not receive a notification on Discord</p>

							<p><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> -  MS Teams is primarily used for all of the group’s meetings and is a secondary platform for communication between group members. The meetings are held twice per week, which is every Wednesday and Saturday at 4:00 PM AEST. </p>

							<p><strong>Figma Community</strong> - Usable data, tables, images were extracted from the Figma Community and use within Figma mockup and prototype of the app. </p>

							<p><strong>GitHub/GitHub Repository</strong> -  Used to contribute to the group’s website. Each member is responsible for adding their part of the assignment to the repository. </p>

							<h2>MS Meetings</h2>
							<p>The group used Discord and Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other. We decided to have weekly meetings on on Wednesday and on Saturday 4 PM AEST. Two meetings per week was sufficient to primarily discuss and work collaboratively on assignment 3. The meeting dates are:</p>
								<ul>

							<h2>GitHub Activities Log Reflection</h2>
							<p>At the start of the assignment, setting up the group GitHub did not take long. We allocated one person to organize and set up the GitHub repository and page. The log of activities on GitHub reflects the group’s work well as everyone contributed to editing the group’s website. The meetings held in MS teams were beneficial and allowed us to discuss and work on the group’s website in real time, and to get solutions to unanswered questions. Overall, although we started late on getting all the content on GitHub, the collaboration went smoothly and towards the submission deadline as everyone was aware of what they needed to accomplish. We had around 100 commits before submitting the assignment.
