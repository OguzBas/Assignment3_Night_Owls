							<p> If I need to hire 4 people for the project, the very first people I would hire would be User Interface Designer. Because, if We know what to design then we can start designing. User Interface designers would be responsible for the interaction between the user and the software. The design patterns, color scheme, fast operation of the app and the tips would be the tasks of the Interface Designer.</p>
   						<p>The second type of people that I can consider for the app can be Cross-Platform App Developer. I would expect from such a person to be knowledgeable about multiple operation platforms in the current industry such as  Android, iPhone and Windows Phones. Then we can produce an app that works in a wider range of platforms.</p>
   						<p>Thirdly, I would probably hire a Program developer to build the backbone of the app. I would expect him to use programming languages like C# and Java, web development languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript or whatever.</p>
   						<p>Lastly, I would hire a Back-end Developer. He or she would be responsible from the security, database management, memory allocation and other skills to manage user records.</p>
